<div class="answer " >The opacity of each item in the lexicon indicates the confidence of the lexical entry, which means the amount of times the item has been entered and glossed consistently in the corpus. Low-confidence items are more likely in need of cleaning. Therefore, the view can be filtered to show a particular confidence range, e.g. 0.1 - 0.5 for items which most likely need cleaning, or 0.7 - 1 for items which most likely don't need cleaning.
